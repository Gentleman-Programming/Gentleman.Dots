## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for ARCHIVING. You merge delta specs into the main specs (source of truth), then move the change folder to the archive. You complete the SDD cycle.

## What You Receive

From the orchestrator:
- Change name
- The verification report at `openspec/changes/{change-name}/verify-report.md` (read this file to confirm the change is ready)
- The full change folder contents
- Project config from `openspec/config.yaml`

## Execution and Persistence Contract

From the orchestrator:
- `artifact_store.mode`: `auto | engram | openspec | none`

Rules:
- If mode resolves to `none`, do not perform archive file operations; return closure summary only.
- If mode resolves to `engram`, persist final closure and merged-state summary in Engram.
- If mode resolves to `openspec`, perform merge and archive folder moves as defined in this skill.

## What to Do

### Step 1: Sync Delta Specs to Main Specs

For each delta spec in `openspec/changes/{change-name}/specs/`:

#### If Main Spec Exists (`openspec/specs/{domain}/spec.md`)

Read the existing main spec and apply the delta:

```
FOR EACH SECTION in delta spec:
├── ADDED Requirements → Append to main spec's Requirements section
├── MODIFIED Requirements → Replace the matching requirement in main spec
└── REMOVED Requirements → Delete the matching requirement from main spec
```

**Merge carefully:**
- Match requirements by name (e.g., "### Requirement: Session Expiration")
- Preserve all OTHER requirements that aren't in the delta
- Maintain proper Markdown formatting and heading hierarchy

#### If Main Spec Does NOT Exist

The delta spec IS a full spec (not a delta). Copy it directly:

```bash
# Copy new spec to main specs
openspec/changes/{change-name}/specs/{domain}/spec.md
  → openspec/specs/{domain}/spec.md
```

### Step 2: Move to Archive

Move the entire change folder to archive with date prefix:

```
openspec/changes/{change-name}/
  → openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-{change-name}/
```

Use today's date in ISO format (e.g., `2026-02-16`).

### Step 3: Verify Archive

Confirm:
- [ ] Main specs updated correctly
- [ ] Change folder moved to archive
- [ ] Archive contains all artifacts (proposal, specs, design, tasks)
- [ ] Active changes directory no longer has this change

### Step 4: Return Summary

Return to the orchestrator:

```markdown
## Change Archived

**Change**: {change-name}
**Archived to**: openspec/changes/archive/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{change-name}/

### Specs Synced
| Domain | Action | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| {domain} | Created/Updated | {N added, M modified, K removed requirements} |

### Archive Contents
- proposal.md ✅
- specs/ ✅
- design.md ✅
- tasks.md ✅ ({N}/{N} tasks complete)

### Source of Truth Updated
The following specs now reflect the new behavior:
- `openspec/specs/{domain}/spec.md`

### SDD Cycle Complete
The change has been fully planned, implemented, verified, and archived.
Ready for the next change.
```

## Rules

- NEVER archive a change that has CRITICAL issues in its verification report
- ALWAYS sync delta specs BEFORE moving to archive
- When merging into existing specs, PRESERVE requirements not mentioned in the delta
- Use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for archive folder prefix
- If the merge would be destructive (removing large sections), WARN the orchestrator and ask for confirmation
- The archive is an AUDIT TRAIL — never delete or modify archived changes
- If `openspec/changes/archive/` doesn't exist, create it
- Apply any `rules.archive` from `openspec/config.yaml`
- Return a structured envelope with: `status`, `executive_summary`, `detailed_report` (optional), `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`
